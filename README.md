# Nathan Fee
Hey I'm Nate, a Software Developer, Marine Veteran and so much more! After my
time in the Marines, I went to college at the University of Massachusetts Lowell
where I recieved my Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice. I took a few classes
in computer science and loved it. After college I worked for FEMA as a Program
Delivery Manager, where I had the privledge of helping communities rebuild
after devistating disasters. While I loved my position, I still craved a to
work with software. A colleage and friend of mine at FEMA told me about a
Web Development Immersive in Boston at General Assembly. I dove right in and
it was one of the best decisions I've made. I get to creativly problem solve
everyday and continue to learn new tools to add to my toolbelt. I'm looking
foward to joining a team of other developers, to help make new and
efficient programs come to life!
